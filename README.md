Random Forest Classification

This repository contains a Random Forest Classifier implementation in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The project demonstrates the complete workflow of building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model with Random Forest.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Import and explore dataset

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling, train-test split)

Train a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

(Optional) Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV

Summarize results and conclusion

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy (data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (model building and evaluation)

ðŸ“Š Results

Random Forest provided robust classification with good accuracy.

Reduced overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree.

Works well for datasets with categorical & numerical features.

Conclusion

Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that achieves high accuracy and generalization. 
It is widely used in real-world classification problems like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and recommendation systems.
